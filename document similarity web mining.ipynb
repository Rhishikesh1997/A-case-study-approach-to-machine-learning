      "top of the hill they found a big hole in the middle of the cobweb and no more \n",
      "spider. Martin had never seen anyone shoot that well and he asked the hunter \n",
      "to join them. \n",
      "   \"Come with us and you'll be in luck!\" The three men walked and walked until\n",
      "they arrived at a windmill. The wheel of the mill was turning even though \n",
      "there was no wind. The men were puzzled but further up the road they found a \n",
      "fat man sitting on a tree stump. The man was blowing through one of his \n",
      "nostrils in the mill's direction. The fat man explained to the three amazed \n",
      "fellow travellers that his strength was such that he could sneeze up a \n",
      "hurricane. The soldier convinced him to follow them. As they approached the \n",
      "city, they were approached by a man who hopped about with his legs tied \n",
      "together.\n",
      "   \"Who tied you up?\" they asked in unison.\n",
      "   \"I did it myself,\" the man, who was very young and very thin, answered. \"If\n",
      "I untied myself I would run as fast as the wind and would not enjoy the \n",
      "sights.\" And so it was that even this character, nicknamed Fastfoot by the \n",
      "others, joined the group. \n",
      "   But the surprises of that extraordinary day were far from over. A little \n",
      "man with a round face sat under a tree. He held his hat over his left ear. \"If\n",
      "I straighten my hat,\" he explained, \"I will freeze everything around me.\" \n",
      "Naturally, everybody took his word for it and the stranger was asked to join \n",
      "the group. The bizarre company finally arrived at the city. A public notice \n",
      "was hung outside the city walls. The princess announced that whoever would \n",
      "beat her in a race could marry her. \n",
      "   The soldier dusted his uniform, cleaned himself up after the long trip and \n",
      "ran to the palace. He wanted to challenge the princess but said that one of \n",
      "his servants would run in his place. The princess accepted his challenge. The \n",
      "morning after, at the starting line, Fastfoot untied his legs and took off \n",
      "like a rocket. Each one of the contestants had a jug that had to be filled at \n",
      "a nearby stream and brought back full to the finish line. On his way back, \n",
      "Fastfoot stopped to pick a flower and after carefully setting the jug on the \n",
      "ground and realizing that the princess was still far away, he decided to lie \n",
      "down and rest for a while. Unfortunately, he fell asleep.\n",
      "   Later on, when the princess caught up with him and saw that he had fallen \n",
      "asleep, she kicked down his jug and ran away. She was sure of her victory. \n",
      "From far away the sharp sighted hunter shot and hit a spot near Fastfoot's \n",
      "ear. Fastfoot woke up all of a sudden and saw the princess approaching the \n",
      "finish line. He quickly ran back to the stream, filled the jug and reached the\n",
      "finish line as fast as lightning. The King was furious. He would never let his\n",
      "daughter marry a miserable soldier.\n",
      "   He invited the unsuspecting Martin to the palace. Martin told him about his\n",
      "two years watching over the river, which made the King ever angrier. The King,\n",
      "however, pretended to feel guilty and invited the soldier and his friends to a\n",
      "banquet in a strange dining room. In fact the dining room was lined with iron \n",
      "walls and was built over a huge furnace. The King ordered his men to seal the \n",
      "dining room's door and to light the furnace. Then he proceeded to watch the \n",
      "slow death of the group through an unbreakable glass. The six men began eating\n",
      "but suddenly felt the floor grow very hot, while the room's temperature \n",
      "rapidly increased.\n",
      "   But Martin did not lose his head. He straightened the hat of the round \n",
      "faced little man and pretty soon they were all shivering from the cold. The \n",
      "King uselessly urged his men to throw more and more wood in the furnace, but \n",
      "the soldier and his fnends had found a remedy to the King's wickedness. No one\n",
      "had ever come out of this torture chamber alive, but this time the King had to\n",
      "accept defeat, even though he was still determined not to let his daughter go.\n",
      "He offered the soldier a large sum of money as long as he gave up the wedding.\n",
      "   \"I will fill you a bag of gold and other riches if you forget the wedding.\"\n",
      "   \"That's fine with me,\" Martin said, \"and I accept your offer but as long as\n",
      "I pick the bag and the man who will carry it away.\" The poor King was unaware \n",
      "of the strength of one of the six friends. When he began filling the sack, all\n",
      "of his gold was not enough to fill it. Martin and his friends were rich. When \n",
      "they left court, the King had become very poor.\n",
      "   The monarch lost his temper and realized the soldier had fooled him. He \n",
      "called the army commander and ordered two battalions to chase Martin. \"Bring \n",
      "them back dead or alive and at all costs!\" Later on, the soldiers caught up \n",
      "with the six young men and surrounded them.\n",
      "   \"Give us back the gold and surrender,\" they demanded. But the fattest of the\n",
      "men began blowing so hard that horses and soldiers were carried away. In just a\n",
      "few minutes the wounded soldiers were scattered all over the plain and the\n",
      "battalions were no longer a threat to the six extraordinary friends who \n",
      "continued their journey. \n",
      "   Then they divided the gold and jewels in equal parts and each one of them \n",

      "after his arrival at the school two years ago.  More than just\n",
      "friends, ran the student/faculty grapevine, but that was really\n",
      "all there was to it.  \n",
      "        He looked up her number in the faculty phone book and dialed\n",
      "it.  \n",
      "        \"Hello.  This is Ellie.  Thanks for calling, but...\" came\n",
      "the sound of her recorded message.  Bruce didn't really want to\n",
      "talk to her answering machine, so he started to hang up.  Then he\n",
      "heard Andy herself.\n",
      "        \"Oh, damn it...hang on a sec...\" Bruce heard the tape speed\n",
      "up until it was incomprehensible, then stop altogether.\n",
      "        \"Hi,\" Bruce said hesitantly.  \"Uh, this is Bruce.\"\n",
      "        \"Bruce!  Hi, how are you?\"  Andy said, slightly out of\n",

      "        \"Well, that's fine, but why are you calling to tell me this,\n",
      "Bruce?  Seriously, now, what's wrong?\"  Ellie had an infuriating\n",
      "way of knowing everybody too well.\n",
      "        Bruce gave it up.  She was a friend, she would understand\n",

      "something else, but \"Bye\" was all she said.\n",
      "        Bruce hung up the receiver and put his head in his hands. \n",
      "He felt like an incredible jackass.  He had called her up to make\n",
      "him feel better, and wound up yelling at her.  Just like an\n",
      "undusciplined child.  It was embarrassing and humiliating.\n",
      "        He sat like that for a few minutes more, and then suddenly\n",
      "sat up.  Three o'clock.  The reading was in England.  But it was\n",
      "later there--six or seven hours later.  He picked up the phone\n",
      "and dialed Joshua's office.\n",

      "The whole affair, starting with the note, bothered him, seemed\n",
      "suspicious.  Why should that note have been left?  Joshua didn't\n",
      "leave it, but he had needed to talk with Bruce anyway.  If it was\n",
      "a prank...but the coincidence was too great.  Somebody must have\n",
      "known, but how?\n",
      "        And the inheritance.  Andrew had owned several little\n",
      "objets d'art--sculptures, paintings, etc.--that had come from\n",
      "Bruce's home but were bequeathed to Andy.  He, Andy, had said\n",
      "many times that they ought to have been Bruce's as they had come\n",
      "from his house (Bruce, however, received the money).  Those were\n",
      "what Bruce expected from Andy.  Nothing of any practical,\n",
      "financial worth (they would never be sold by him), just sent-\n",

      "them?  What about the coins that Joshua had spoken about? \n",
      "Perhaps they, too, were worth something.  And the documents...\n",
      "yes, it all fit in, now.  Andrew had given to Bruce some things\n",
      "which he could sell for himself.  To make a lttle money.  It was\n",

      "        \n",
      "        In the morning, Bruce's head was clearer, probably helped by\n",
      "the fact that it was, indeed, Saturday, and he had an excuse not\n",
      "to go to that damn meeting.  He lay in bed for a while, trying to\n",
      "fall asleep for a few more minutes, but the more he tried the\n",
      "more he woke up.  He got out of bed and went to the kitchen for\n",
      "some coffee.\n",

      "        As he drained the cup, he suddenly heard a thunk outside his\n",

      "himself, in sweatpants and no shirt.  \"Hang on!\"  he yelled,\n",
      "running back to his bedroom to pull on a T-shirt.\n",
      "        He looked through the peephole.  There was a man in a\n",

      "arm.  Bruce opened the door.\n",
      "        \"Bruce Williams?\"  said the man.  Bruce nodded.  The man\n",
      "gave him the envelope and bent to pick up a package at his feet.\n",
      "        \"I'll do that,\"  Bruce said, sliding it across the threshold\n",
      "into the hall with his foot.  He dropped the envelope on top of\n",
      "it.  \n",
      "        \"Please sign this.\"  The courier gave Bruce a clipboard and\n",
      "Bruce signed the receipt.  \"Thank you.\"  The man tore off a\n",
      "carbon copy, handed it to Bruce, and left.\n",
      "        Bruce closed the door, picked up the envelope and balanced\n",
      "it on his arm, lifted the package with his other arm, and entered\n",
      "the kitchen, dropping them on the table.  He got a knife out of\n",
      "a drawer and tore off the tape on the package.  It opened to\n",
      "reveal two books.\n",
      "        The books were remnants of what was once beautiful. \n",

      "azure, one in emerald.  Now they were simply aged blue and green,\n",
      "darkened by years of handling, or shelf-life, or both.  Bruce\n",

      "in Literature (blue), and World (green).  \n",
      "        Bruce didn't open the envelope.  Instead, he picked up the\n",
      "blue book and leafed through it.  The print was large and written\n",
      "in a sort of primitive italic font.  He sat down, there, and\n",
      "began to read.\n",
      "        The book was simply a novel of one man's life.  He lived in\n",

      "described in detail, so as to give an excellent portrait of the\n",
